# pvz-interception-calculator
* a calculator (also named "brain-vs-zombies") that computes the time and space data of plants &amp; zombies precisely


# Description

This calculator is capable of doing most of the common PVZ game object computations and has the exact same accuracy as the original program. Users may use it to simulate movement of zombies (imps in particular) or check to see if a cannon given specific position is able to intercept imps thrown by gargantuars.


# Tech Note
The main program is written in Python and is exported as a terminal program using pyinstaller.
